# Epic 2
- Create a new React application using `create-react-app`.
   - Design the user interface for TaskMaster. It should include:
     - A dashboard displaying the list of tasks.
     - The ability to add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
     - The ability to edit existing tasks.
     - The ability to mark tasks as completed and delete tasks.
   - Implement user interactions such as form submission, editing, and deletion. (Implement JavaScript Event Handlers for this)
   - Use React components to structure your application logically.
